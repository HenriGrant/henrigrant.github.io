                <h2>Contact Info to QR Code</h2>
                <h3>Problem Definition - <em>How can I make a digital iteration of a physical business card?</em></h3>
                <h3>Solution - <em>Create a QR code generator from vCard text in Shortcuts app</em></h3>
                <p>I made business cards to give out, but I also wanted something to instantly share my contact information
                    digitally.
                    One idea I came up with was using NFC, but those devices are pricey. I then looked at the Dot card, but
                    that is subscription based.
                    I ended up thinking of storing vCard data in a QR code. I looked it up and sure enough, people have
                    already created this.
                    However, I don't trust these sites enough to give them my data.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I looked up vCard data, and found <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VCard">this wiki page</a>.
                    Okay, I thought, this is in plaintext.
                    I learned how vCards worked, and I exported and edited my contact vCard on my Mac.
                </p>
                <p>I have used the Shortcuts app before, so I went into the app to see if I could generate a QR code in
                    it. Sure enough, you can.
                    I then took a few hours creating "code" and debugging until I came up with the final draft. I even added
                    a feature that stores a note in the vCard of when the
                    contact was added.
                    <br>Here is what the code looks like:
